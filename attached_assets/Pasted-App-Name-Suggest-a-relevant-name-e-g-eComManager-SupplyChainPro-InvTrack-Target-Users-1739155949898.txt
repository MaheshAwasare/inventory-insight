App Name: (Suggest a relevant name, e.g., "eComManager," "SupplyChainPro," "InvTrack")

Target Users: E-commerce business owners, inventory managers, supply chain managers, warehouse staff.

Core Functionalities:

Inventory Management: (Same as previous prompt, but with mock mode considerations)

Product Catalog:

Prompt: Design the product catalog to work seamlessly in both mock and backend modes.
Components:
Supabase (Backend Mode): Tables for products, categories, variations, etc.
Mock Data (Mock Mode): Create mock data in JSON format for products, categories, etc. Consider using a library like Faker.js for generating realistic mock data.
React: Components should use a conditional approach to fetch data. If MODE is backend, use the Supabase client. If MODE is mock, use the mock data. Abstract data fetching logic into reusable functions or hooks.
Stock Tracking: (Same considerations for mock/backend)

Warehouse Management (Optional): (Same considerations for mock/backend)

Supplier Management: (Same as previous prompt, but with mock mode considerations)

Supplier Database: (Same considerations for mock/backend)

Purchase Orders (POs): (Same considerations for mock/backend)

Supplier Performance Tracking (Optional): (Same considerations for mock/backend)

Reporting and Analytics:

Prompt: Design the reporting system to work in both modes. In mock mode, generate reports based on the mock data.
Components:
Supabase (Backend Mode): Supabase SQL queries.
Mock Data (Mock Mode): Functions to process and aggregate mock data for reports.
React: Components for displaying reports, using conditional logic based on MODE.
User Management and Security:

Prompt: In mock mode, implement a simplified authentication system (e.g., hardcoded credentials or a simple login form that always succeeds). In backend mode, use Supabase Auth.
Components:
Supabase (Backend Mode): Supabase Auth.
Mock Authentication (Mock Mode): Implement mock authentication.
React: Components for login/signup, protected routes, and user context, using conditional logic based on MODE.
Integrations:

Prompt: In mock mode, provide mock responses for any external API calls.
Components:
Supabase (Backend Mode): Supabase Functions or a separate backend service.
Mock Integrations (Mock Mode): Implement mock API calls and responses.
React: Components for triggering integration actions, using conditional logic based on MODE.
Technical Considerations:

Frontend: React
Backend: Supabase (or Mock Mode)
State Management: Redux, Context API, or similar
UI Library: Material UI, Ant Design, or similar (optional)
Routing: React Router
Database: PostgreSQL (provided by Supabase - Backend Mode) / JSON (Mock Mode)
Storage: Supabase Storage (Backend Mode) / Mock Storage (Mock Mode - e.g., in-memory or local storage)
Authentication: Supabase Auth (Backend Mode) / Mock Authentication (Mock Mode)
Environment Variable: MODE (either mock or backend)
Implementation Details for Mock Mode:

Data Fetching: Create custom hooks or functions (e.g., useProducts, useSuppliers) that handle data fetching based on the MODE variable.
Mock API Calls: In mock mode, these hooks/functions should return mock data directly instead of making API calls to Supabase.
Conditional Rendering: Use the MODE variable to conditionally render UI elements or components that depend on the backend functionality (e.g., showing Supabase-specific features only in backend mode).
Mock Storage: If you need to simulate file storage in mock mode, you can use in-memory storage (for quick testing) or local storage (for persistence across sessions).
UI/UX Design: (Same as previous prompt)

Deliverables:

React source code
Supabase SQL scripts (for table creation, RLS policies, etc. - only for backend mode)
Mock data files (JSON)
API documentation (Supabase automatically generates API docs - only for backend mode)
User manual
